The project is made up of three distinct but interlinked studies analyzing children's:

1. Socioemotional development
2. Educational aspirations and expectations
3. Early family formation and transition to adulthood

We asks these questions by conducting comparable longitudinal surveys of children and their caregivers in households with and without migrants in three traditional sending areas: Jalisco, Mexico; Gaza, Mozambique; and Chitwan, Nepal.
