abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic
  events that occur before the age of 18. Researchers have examined the negative associations
  between adversity and adolescent and adult outcomes, such as education and physical
  health. However, research on ACEs, and their association with other outcomes in
  non-western contexts is sparse. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to increase our
  understanding of the prevalence of ACEs - and their association with educational
  aspirations - in low- and middle-income country contexts. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING:
  We utilize data from the Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes (FAMELO) project,
  a multi-site survey project that collected data from families in historically high-migration
  contexts. ACEs and educational aspirations were measured in children aged 11 to17
  years in Mexico (n = 853), Mozambique (n = 651), and Nepal (n = 1180). METHODS:
  We use Poisson regressions to examine the prevalence of ACEs in multiple cultures,
  and then use multinomial logistic regressions to examine whether ACEs are associated
  with educational aspirations, as a practical application of the utility of the ACEs
  framework in cross-cultural contexts. RESULTS: Our results suggest that adolescents
  in Mozambique have a higher average number of ACEs (2.7) than adolescents in Mexico
  (1.4) and Nepal (1.3). Female adolescents reported fewer ACEs, while socioeconomic
  vulnerabilities (low-income and low parental education) were associated with higher
  exposure to ACEs, with differences by country. Lastly, ACEs were associated with
  lower educational aspirations in Mexico and Nepal. CONCLUSIONS: Our study attempted
  to heed the call of many scholars who have pushed for an expansion of research on
  ACEs in non-western, low- and middle-income country contexts.'
