abstract: Objective This article analyzes the relationship between educational aspirations
  and fertility aspirations early in the life course in three different settings.
  Background The negative relationship between women's educational attainment and
  childbearing is one of the most consistent associations in social science. Family
  scholars have a more limited understanding of the relationship between educational
  aspirations and fertility aspirations before childbearing or union formation. Method
  The authors use data collected in Jalisco, Mexico; Gaza, Mozambique; and Chitwan
  Valley, Nepal as part of the Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes project. They
  estimate nested Poisson regressions to model the relationship between adolescent
  educational aspirations and desired family size, controlling for individual- and
  household-level sociodemographic variables as well as adolescent beliefs and values.
  Results On average, adolescents who desire more education want fewer children in
  unadjusted models. In Mozambique and Nepal, this association is attenuated in models
  accounting for household characteristics. In Mexico, the association persists after
  incorporating these factors, but the inclusion of individual aspirations attenuates
  the relationship between educational aspirations and desired family size. In Mozambique,
  the association of educational aspirations with desired family size is moderated
  by gender. Conclusion As young people enter adolescence, their desires for education
  and childbearing are inversely related, but the mechanisms driving this association
  vary across contexts. This variation may be related to linkages between education,
  social status, and family values.
