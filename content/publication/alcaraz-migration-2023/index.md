abstract: Migration systems shape social life, including the timing and sequencing
  of key demographic behaviors such as marriage, childbearing, and household formation.
  Existing research has linked migration and marriage in Mexico through various mechanisms
  but provides less guidance on whether aspirations for migration and marriage are
  closely linked. Given that union formation is distinct within migration contexts,
  this article focuses on adolescents’ plans for marriage and the extent to which
  migration aspirations shape the desired timing of their union formation, by examining
  how four distinct measures of migration aspirations are related to adolescents’
  ideal ages at union formation in rural Jalisco, Mexico. Drawing from data on adolescents
  (n = 1,403 adolescents) from the Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes (FAMELO)
  project (collected in 2017–2018), it uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
  to analyze how various types of adolescent migration aspirations — including permanent
  migration, temporary labor migration, leaving the community at any point in time,
  and expected migration location — are associated with adolescents’ ideal age at
  union formation. Results reveal that all migration aspirations are associated with
  higher ideal ages at the marriage in unconditional models. However, these associations
  are not always robust to the inclusion of other factors, including adolescent aspirations
  in other life domains, particularly education. Results highlight the ongoing transition
  from a “culture of migration” to a “culture of education” in Mexico. Given that
  Mexican migration has changed dramatically in recent years, the findings presented
  here provide a window for understanding how these changes in migration are reflected
  in adolescent goals and likely subsequent behavior.
