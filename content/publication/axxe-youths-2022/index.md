abstract: Subjective adulthood, or feeling like an adult, captures identity development
  relative to the local context that shapes life course processes. Most research on
  this topic is conducted in wealthy developed countries. Instead, we draw on household-based
  survey data from the Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes project (FAMELO) to
  estimate ordinal logistic regression models predicting how often adolescents aged
  11–17 in Jalisco, Mexico (n = 1,567); Gaza Province, Mozambique (n = 1,368); and
  the Chitwan Valley, Nepal (n = 1,898), identify as adults. The relationships between
  adult roles, family capital, youth characteristics, and youth’s adult identities
  vary substantially across the sites. The findings highlight how the transition to
  adulthood reflects the cultural and structural conditions of adult identities.
