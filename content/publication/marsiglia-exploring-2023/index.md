abstract: We assessed the association between educational aspirations and the intention
  to migrate among 1446 adolescents aged 11–17 years, living in semi-urban/rural communities
  in Jalisco, Mexico. Analyses rely on survey data from the Family Migration and Early
  Life Outcomes study. The outcome variable was the intention to migrate, a three-category
  variable coded as no intention to migrate, intention to migrate within Mexico, and
  intention to migrate internationally. The main independent variable was the adolescents'
  educational aspirations, conceptualized as the intention to achieve higher education.
  Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations. We found
  an association between educational aspirations and intentions to migrate, and it
  was moderated by gender. Girls with the highest educational aspirations intended
  to migrate internationally, while higher educational aspirations were not a driver
  for boys' migration intentions. The study findings have implications for education
  and migration policies and future research.
