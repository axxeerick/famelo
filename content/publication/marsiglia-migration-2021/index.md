abstract: This study explores the association between migration intentions and alcohol
  use among west-central Mexico adolescents living in high migration communities.
  This study used the baseline data from the Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes
  (FAMELO) project (N = 1286), collected in 2018. We used multiple imputations to
  address missingness and propensity score matching to reduce the selection bias.
  We also conducted subgroup analyses to compare gender difference (i.e., boys vs.
  girls) on the relationship between migration intention and alcohol use. The findings
  show that for the whole sample, youth with migration intentions had significant
  higher odds (OR = 1.78; p = .010) of having a lifetime drinking experience when
  compared to youth who reported no interest in living abroad, but this association
  remained significant only for boys (OR = 2.14; p = .010). This study makes an important
  contribution to our understanding of the etiology of migration intentions and alcohol
  use for adolescents living in sending migration communities. The findings have specific
  alcohol prevention, policy, and future research implications in Mexico and the U.S.
