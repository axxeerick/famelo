abstract: "How migration influences social competence when children are left-behind in their communities of origin is not well understood. We believe family members’ migration alters children’s experiences, and how family members engage with and provide resources to children. In turn, these changes may affect social competence. We investigated how migration predicts parent-child communication, social support, and children’s social competence using Year 1 data from our longitudinal study. 

In a representative sample of households (N = 2,341) in Chitwan Valley, Nepal, we interviewed caregivers of 5 to 17 year olds. The older children (≥ 11 years) also provided self-reports. Furthermore, we interviewed currently migrating fathers (n = 597). 

Nearly 49% of households had one or more migrant currently away. Mothers from 8.1%, and fathers from 54.0%, of households had migrated at least once. Migration was associated with differences in parent-child communication. For instance, if mothers were away (vs. not) children communicated less with both parents, and if fathers were away (vs. not) children had less communication with fathers. If at least one household member was currently migrating (vs. nobody migrating) or if more family members were migrating, children received less social support from parents but more support from other family members. 

We developed measures of social competence for younger and for older Nepali children. Household members’ current migration and history of migration negatively predicted both social competence dimensions--behavioral control and social initiative, controlling for children’s sex, age, caste, household assets, and caregivers’ education. 

Migrant fathers’ reports suggested they “parent from afar” using technology. Some aspects of migrant father-child relationships predicted left-behind children’s behavioral control and social initiative (controlling for sex, age, caste, assets, and education). 

Results provide a first look at the socio-emotional adjustment of “left-behind” children in Nepal, and initial support for our ideas regarding how migration affects social competence.
